## Part C : RSA Implementation
RSA is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. It
relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. RSA uses a public key for
encryption and a private key for decryption.
RSA is based on some neat number theory:
    • It uses two large prime numbers to create a modulus for both encryption and decryption.
    • The public key is made of this modulus and an exponent.
    • The private key is mathematically related to the public key, but it’s kept secret.
